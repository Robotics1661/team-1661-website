Team 1661's first competition was in Port Hueneme in Oxnard. The team traveled to Orange County for another competition where they made it to the quarter finals and finished 13 out of 42 teams. Most recently, the team traveled to Fresno for their competition where they placed 21 out of 42 teams.

Like clockwork, the team met everyday after-school from January through March until 6:30 p.m and Saturdays from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., dedicating time and energy into preparing for their competitions. \

“The work was intense. Students worked from morning to evening… \[at the end] each member reported a tremendous sense of accomplishment and success,” said Paul Barker, robotics advisor. Congratulations to Buckley’s Griffitrons on their accomplishments and hard work! 



The next season will start in January 2023 and end in April, with plans to go to three regional competitions and hope to qualify for the World Competition in Houston.
