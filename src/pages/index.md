description: Team 1661 is a FIRST Robotics Competition team located at the
  Buckley School in Sherman Oaks, CA. We've been competing in FRC since our
  team's inception in 2005 and have won multiple competition awards over the
  years. Our team typically consists of 15-30 members, and we are working to
  expand both the team and our efforts to promote STEAM education in our school
  and local community. We would love to connect with other teams, potential
  sponsors, or anyone interested, so contact us!
