  Sherman Oaks, CA. We've been competing in FRC since our team's inception in 2005
  and have won multiple competition awards over the years. Our team typically consists
  of 15-30 members, and we are working to expand both the team and our efforts to
  promote STEAM education in our school and local community. We would love to connect
  with other teams, potential sponsors, or anyone interested, so contact us!

  description: >
    Kaldi is the ultimate spot for coffee lovers who want to learn about their
    java’s origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take coffee
    production, roasting and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass that
    knowledge to anyone. This is an edit via identity...

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
